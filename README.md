# style-guide

This repository contains SASS that's used to generate common CSS styles that can be shared across the product
(platform, devrel, security, etc).

__Why SASS?__

Currently, we use a number of different component libraries across our products. This allows our teams to experiment 
around with different tools and frameworks to figure out which one works best for them. To avoid prescribing a solution
we decided to generate CSS as a stepping stone to a more thorough component library.
